        function1: Automatically save your tweet at 00:00 Every Day.
        function1-more: When registering for the first time, get a tweet and store it for two weeks back. It is difficult to acquire it since it is caught by the restriction of Twitter API beyond that.
        function2: Since only the tweet is displayed on the timeline, do not worry about wasting time!
        function3: If you tweet normally, you can leave it automatically as "What did you do on that day?" Log.
        function4: Usually, past tweets can not be seen unless you do a lot of flick ... you can manage where the place is easy to see with the calendar.
        other-header: Other
        other1: free.
        other2: need a Twitter account.
        other3: Because this is a login authentication method called OAuth 2, the password is not saved in this application.
        other4: Read permission only. We will not automatically post to Twitter from this application.
